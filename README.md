# Soil methane gas emissions - concentrations 

This project investigate the link between the changes in soil structure and the measured concentrations of major greenhouse gases. At the CESEP lab a 3D tank was packed with several sand layers and gas injection ports were fixed at a certain depth in the soil. To measure the soil methane gas injected in the 3D sandy tank, figaro methane gas sensors (low-cost sensors) were used along with a FID methane detector system.
